> 'w'	Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first
> 'rb' or 'wb'	Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)

- in this form:

|'r'	| Open for reading (default)|
|'w'	| Open for writing, truncating (overwriting) the file first|
|'rb' or 'wb'	| Open in binary mode (read/write using byte data)|
