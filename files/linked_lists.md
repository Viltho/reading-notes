### Linked Lists

- Linked lists is a data structure consisting of a sequence of nodes that are connected to each other. There are two types of linked lists: singly and doubly linked lists. Each node in a linked list contains a property called Next, which points to the next node in the list. The Head is a reference to the first node in a linked list, and the Current is a reference to the node that is currently being examined.

- Traversing a linked list involves checking the Next value in each node to guide where the next reference is pointing. The Current variable tells us where we are in the linked list and allows us to move forward until we reach the end.

- The Big O of time for Includes, a method to check if a linked list includes a specific value, is O(n) because, at worst, the node being looked for is the last node in the list. Adding a node to a linked list requires replacing the current Head of the linked list with the new node without losing the reference to the next node in the list.

- Arrays are static, whereas linked lists are dynamic and can expand or contract in memory. Linked lists operate necessitates a rudimentary comprehension of memory allocation in computer programs.
