# about SQL:
Relational databases are a type of database that stores and organizes data in tables that are related to one another based on common fields. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and the relationships between tables are defined by the use of foreign keys.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage relational databases. It allows users to create, modify, and query databases, and is used to retrieve data from tables based on specific criteria or conditions.

SQL uses a set of commands or statements to interact with a database, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN. These statements allow users to create and manipulate data, as well as retrieve and display data in meaningful ways.

Relational databases and SQL are widely used in many industries and applications, from e-commerce websites to financial institutions, due to their ability to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data while maintaining data integrity and consistency.
