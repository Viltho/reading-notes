## things i would like to know more about

- A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of vertices and edges. The vertices are sometimes also referred to as nodes and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph. More formally a Graph is composed of a set of vertices( V ) and a set of edges( E ). The graph is denoted by G(E, V).

- Graphs has 3 types, either weighted directed or weighted directed

- Graphs has a shape of a tree but does not work as one

- Graphs has nodes and each node can be connected via an edge this edge is what can be weighted

- Graphs can be seen in perfect example of a map implementation

- Graphs can be reversed in direction as well.
