## things i would like to know more about

### Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions provide a way to control access to APIs by defining rules and restrictions. They help in securing an API by determining who can perform certain actions on the API endpoints. The key components of DRF permissions include:

1. Permission classes: These are classes that define the rules for accessing the API endpoints. They determine whether a user has the necessary permissions to perform specific actions such as creating, reading, updating, or deleting data.

2. Authentication: DRF permissions work in conjunction with authentication classes to verify the identity of the users accessing the API. Authentication classes handle the process of authenticating users using various methods like token authentication, session authentication, or OAuth.

3. Authorization: Once a user is authenticated, authorization classes come into play to check if the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to perform the requested action. Authorization classes determine whether a user can perform a particular action on a specific resource.

DRF permissions allow developers to enforce fine-grained access control on API endpoints. They can be used to restrict access to certain resources based on user roles, group membership, object ownership, or custom business logic.

### In SQL, the SELECT statement is used to retrieve data from a database table. Its purpose is to query and fetch specific columns or rows from a table based on the specified criteria. To retrieve all columns from a table called 'employees', you would use the following SQL statement:


    SELECT * FROM employees;

The asterisk (*) is a wildcard character that represents all columns in the table. By using it in the SELECT clause, you retrieve all columns of the 'employees' table.

DRF Generic Views provide a set of reusable view classes that simplify the process of building RESTful APIs. They encapsulate common functionalities and provide default implementations for CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) operations. The main advantage of using DRF Generic Views is that they reduce code duplication and promote consistency across API endpoints.

### Here are a few examples of DRF Generic Views:

    ListAPIView: This view provides a read-only endpoint that lists all objects in a model. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method.
<br>

    RetrieveAPIView: This view retrieves a single object from a model based on a unique identifier. It corresponds to the HTTP GET method with a specific object ID.
<br>

    CreateAPIView: This view allows the creation of new objects in a model. It corresponds to the HTTP POST method.
<br>

    UpdateAPIView: This view updates an existing object in a model. It corresponds to the HTTP PUT or PATCH method.
<br>

    DestroyAPIView: This view deletes an existing object from a model. It corresponds to the HTTP DELETE method.
<br>

DRF Generic Views provide a basic implementation for these common API operations, but they can be customized by subclassing and overriding specific methods. They allow developers to quickly build RESTful APIs by leveraging the common functionalities provided by the generic views.
