## Things i would like to know more about

1. Key differences between scraping static and dynamic websites:
- Static websites: These websites have fixed content that doesn't change frequently. The HTML markup is generated on the server-side and delivered to the client as-is. Scraping static websites usually involves downloading the HTML source code and parsing it to extract the desired data. The data extraction process is relatively straightforward since the structure remains consistent over time.

- Dynamic websites: These websites generate content dynamically using client-side technologies like JavaScript. The HTML markup is often a starting point, but additional data is loaded and rendered dynamically through JavaScript code execution. Scraping dynamic websites requires a more advanced approach. The web scraper needs to simulate a web browser, execute JavaScript, and capture the dynamically generated content.

2. Techniques to avoid getting blocked while scraping websites:

- Respect robots.txt: The robots.txt file is a standard used by websites to indicate which parts of their site should not be accessed by web crawlers. Scraper developers should check and respect this file to avoid crawling restricted areas.

- Use user-agent headers: Many websites monitor the user-agent header in HTTP requests to identify and potentially block scraping activity. Modifying the user-agent string to mimic a legitimate browser can help avoid detection.

- Implement request throttling: Scraping too quickly or sending a large number of requests in a short period can trigger anti-scraping mechanisms. By introducing delays between requests and limiting the number of requests per minute, you can mimic human browsing behavior and reduce the chances of being blocked.

3. Playwright and its benefits in web scraping:

- Playwright is an open-source automation library developed by Microsoft that provides a high-level API for browser automation. It allows developers to control web browsers programmatically, making it ideal for web scraping tasks. Some benefits of using Playwright include:

- Cross-browser support: Playwright supports multiple web browsers like Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit. This flexibility allows you to choose the browser that best suits your scraping needs.

- JavaScript execution: Playwright can execute JavaScript on the page, making it suitable for scraping dynamic websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for content generation.

- Headless and headful mode: Playwright allows you to run the browser in headless mode (without a visible UI) or headful mode (with a visible UI). Headless mode is often used for efficient and faster scraping, while headful mode can be beneficial for debugging and handling CAPTCHAs.

Example use case: Playwright can be particularly beneficial when scraping websites that heavily rely on JavaScript for content rendering. For instance, if you want to scrape a website that loads data dynamically through AJAX requests or modifies the DOM based on user interactions, Playwright can simulate these interactions and extract the rendered data efficiently.

4. Purpose of using XPath in web scraping:
- XPath (XML Path Language) is a query language used to navigate and select elements in an XML or HTML document. In web scraping, XPath is commonly used to locate specific elements within the HTML structure. It provides a flexible and powerful way to extract data from a webpage.
