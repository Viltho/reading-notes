Using a Django Custom User Model offers several benefits over the default Django User Model:

1. Flexibility: With a Custom User Model, you have more control over the user model's fields, allowing you to tailor it to your specific application's requirements. You can add or modify fields as needed, such as adding additional profile information or extending the authentication process.

2. Scalability: A Custom User Model provides scalability by allowing you to add or remove fields without worrying about backward compatibility issues. This flexibility is especially useful when your application evolves and requires additional user-related data.

3. Authentication Enhancements: You can customize the authentication process by adding new authentication methods or implementing different authentication backends. This enables you to integrate with external authentication providers or implement alternative login mechanisms like social logins.

4. Consistency: By creating a Custom User Model, you can ensure consistency throughout your project. If you need to reference the user model in any foreign key relationships, using a Custom User Model ensures that all references point to the same model, regardless of whether you're using the default authentication or a custom one.

- To create and implement a Custom User Model in Django, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Django app or use an existing one to hold your custom user model. Let's assume the app is named "accounts".

2. Inside the "accounts" app, create a new file called "models.py" and define your custom user model class. Here's an example:

        from django.contrib.auth.models import AbstractUser
        from django.db import models

        class CustomUser(AbstractUser):
            # Add custom fields as needed
            bio = models.TextField(blank=True)

        """ Replace the default username field with your preferred identifier """
        email = models.EmailField(unique=True)

        """ Update the REQUIRED_FIELDS list to include all the fields required during user creation """
        REQUIRED_FIELDS = ['email']

        def __str__(self):
            return self.username

- In this example, we're extending the AbstractUser class provided by Django and adding a "bio" field and using email as the username field.

3. Open your project's "settings.py" file and locate the AUTH_USER_MODEL setting. Uncomment it and set it to the path of your CustomUser model, such as "accounts.CustomUser". It should look like this:

        AUTH_USER_MODEL = 'accounts.CustomUser'

4. Next, create and run the migration to create the necessary database table for your CustomUser model:

        python manage.py makemigrations accounts
        python manage.py migrate

5. Finally, update any references to the User model throughout your project with the path to your CustomUser model (accounts.CustomUser in this example).

- By following these steps, you have successfully created and implemented a Custom User Model in Django.

- DjangoX is not a specific component of Django. As of my knowledge cutoff in September 2021, there is no widely known package called DjangoX. However, DjangoX could potentially refer to a custom package or project built on top of Django to extend its functionality. Without more specific information about DjangoX, it is difficult to provide an example use case or explain its complementing or extending capabilities.
