### what did Alain Do Bottom talking about ?

A gentler philosophy of success could focus on embracing the idea that success is not just about individual achievement, but also about the collective well-being of society. It could prioritize values such as empathy, kindness, and collaboration over individualism and competition. This approach would acknowledge that everyone's success is interconnected and that we all have a responsibility to contribute to the greater good.

Another aspect of a gentler philosophy of success could be accepting and embracing failure as an inevitable part of the learning process. This would involve recognizing that failure is not a personal weakness or a sign of incompetence, but a natural step in the journey towards success. This approach would encourage individuals to take risks, experiment, and learn from their mistakes, without fearing judgment or ridicule from others.

Ultimately, a gentler philosophy of success would prioritize personal growth and well-being over material wealth or social status. It would encourage individuals to define success on their own terms, based on their unique values and aspirations, rather than conforming to society's narrow definitions of success. This approach would help individuals lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives, while also contributing to a more compassionate and equitable society.
