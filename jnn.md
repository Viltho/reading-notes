Jupyter Lab vs. Jupyter Notebook:
Jupyter Lab is an integrated development environment (IDE) for Jupyter Notebook, which allows you to work with notebooks, code files, and data files in a more flexible and user-friendly way. Some of the key features and benefits of Jupyter Lab include:

Multi-window interface: Jupyter Lab has a flexible interface that allows you to arrange multiple notebooks, consoles, and files side by side in separate windows or tabs.

Integrated file browser: Jupyter Lab has an integrated file browser that makes it easy to navigate and manage your files and folders.

Interactive data visualization: Jupyter Lab includes interactive data visualization tools such as Bokeh and Plotly, which allow you to create interactive charts and graphs directly in your notebooks.

Built-in terminal: Jupyter Lab has a built-in terminal, which allows you to run command-line tools and scripts directly from the IDE.

Extensions and plugins: Jupyter Lab has a modular architecture that allows you to customize and extend its functionality with plugins and extensions.

In contrast, Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing environment that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations, and narrative text. While Jupyter Notebook is still widely used, Jupyter Lab offers more advanced features and a more modern user interface.

NumPy library and its functionalities:
NumPy is a Python library for scientific computing that provides a powerful array data structure and a wide range of functions for numerical operations. Some of the main functionalities provided by NumPy include:

Array creation and manipulation: NumPy provides functions for creating arrays of various shapes and sizes, as well as functions for manipulating arrays, such as slicing, reshaping, and concatenating.

Mathematical operations: NumPy provides a wide range of mathematical functions for performing operations on arrays, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and trigonometric functions.

Linear algebra: NumPy provides functions for performing linear algebra operations on arrays, such as matrix multiplication, determinants, and eigenvalues.

Statistics: NumPy provides functions for computing statistical properties of arrays, such as mean, variance, and correlation coefficients.

Random number generation: NumPy provides functions for generating random numbers from various distributions, such as normal, uniform, and Poisson.

NumPy is particularly useful in scientific computing and data manipulation tasks because it allows you to perform fast and efficient numerical operations on large arrays of data.

NumPy arrays:
NumPy arrays are a powerful data structure that allows you to store and manipulate arrays of numerical data. The basic structure of a NumPy array is a homogeneous collection of elements, all of the same data type, arranged in a multidimensional grid. Some key properties of NumPy arrays include:

Shape: The shape of a NumPy array is a tuple that specifies the size of each dimension of the array.

Data type: NumPy arrays have a fixed data type, which can be specified when the array is created.

Indexing and slicing: NumPy arrays can be indexed and sliced in various ways, allowing you to access and manipulate specific elements or subarrays of the array.

Here are some examples of how to create, manipulate, and perform operations on NumPy arrays:

    import numpy as np

    # Create a 1-dimensional array
    a = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

    # Create a 2-dimensional array
    b = np.array([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]])

    # Access individual elements of an array
    print(a[0]) # 1
    print(b[1, 2]) # 6

    # Slice an array to
