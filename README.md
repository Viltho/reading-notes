# about SQL:
Relational databases are a type of database that stores and organizes data in tables that are related to one another based on common fields. Each table represents a specific entity or concept, and the relationships between tables are defined by the use of foreign keys.

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language used to manage relational databases. It allows users to create, modify, and query databases, and is used to retrieve data from tables based on specific criteria or conditions.

SQL uses a set of commands or statements to interact with a database, including SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, and JOIN. These statements allow users to create and manipulate data, as well as retrieve and display data in meaningful ways.

Relational databases and SQL are widely used in many industries and applications, from e-commerce websites to financial institutions, due to their ability to efficiently store and retrieve large amounts of data while maintaining data integrity and consistency.

# Terminal 

- The command line, also known as the terminal, is a text-based interface to the system where users can enter commands and receive feedback as text. The tutorial explains how to open a terminal and introduces the Bash shell, which is the most common shell used in Linux. It also covers basic navigation, including how to traverse the command history using the up and down arrow keys, and how to use shortcuts.

- In this tutorial, he covers the basics of navigation in the Linux file system. Ryan starts by explaining the importance of knowing your current working directory and how to use the pwd command to print it. He then demonstrates how to list the contents of the current directory using the ls command and explains its usage with different options and arguments. Ryan also explains the concept of paths and the difference between absolute and relative paths. He ends the tutorial with an example of how to use these paths to list the contents of a specific directory.

- It starts by explaining that everything in Linux is a file, including directories, text files, and input/output devices. The tutorial then goes on to explain that Linux is an extensionless system, meaning that the system ignores file extensions and instead looks inside the file to determine its type. The tutorial also notes that Linux is case-sensitive and provides examples of how to use quotes or escape characters to deal with spaces in file names. Finally, the tutorial explains how Linux handles hidden files and directories, which are indicated by a dot (.) at the beginning of their name.

- The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system, including what they do, the specifics of how you run them, and what command line arguments they accept. You can invoke the manual pages with the following command: man <command to look up>. The tutorial explains the structure of the manual pages, which includes the command name, the synopsis, a description of the command, and a list of all the available command line options. You can also search the manual pages for a specific keyword or term, and you can search within a manual page. The tutorial also explains the differences between long hand and short hand command line options, and provides some activities for practicing with the ls command and searching through the manual pages.

- The tutorial then explains how to remove directories using the "rmdir" command, and how to create blank files using the "touch" command. Finally, it covers how to copy files and directories using the "cp" command. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of organizing files in an elegant file structure and using the command line effectively by understanding how different commands function.

- The cheat sheet provides a quick reference for using the Linux command line. It covers basic navigation commands like pwd, ls, and cd, as well as file manipulation commands like mkdir, touch, cp, and rm. It also includes information on permissions, process management, and filters like grep and sort. Additionally, it covers piping and redirection, wildcards, and provides some useful commands for finding file sizes, shutting down the system, and more. It's important to note that this cheat sheet assumes some familiarity with the Linux command line, so if you're new to it, it's recommended to start with a beginner's tutorial.
