# Terminal 

- The command line, also known as the terminal, is a text-based interface to the system where users can enter commands and receive feedback as text. The tutorial explains how to open a terminal and introduces the Bash shell, which is the most common shell used in Linux. It also covers basic navigation, including how to traverse the command history using the up and down arrow keys, and how to use shortcuts.

- In this tutorial, he covers the basics of navigation in the Linux file system. Ryan starts by explaining the importance of knowing your current working directory and how to use the pwd command to print it. He then demonstrates how to list the contents of the current directory using the ls command and explains its usage with different options and arguments. Ryan also explains the concept of paths and the difference between absolute and relative paths. He ends the tutorial with an example of how to use these paths to list the contents of a specific directory.

- It starts by explaining that everything in Linux is a file, including directories, text files, and input/output devices. The tutorial then goes on to explain that Linux is an extensionless system, meaning that the system ignores file extensions and instead looks inside the file to determine its type. The tutorial also notes that Linux is case-sensitive and provides examples of how to use quotes or escape characters to deal with spaces in file names. Finally, the tutorial explains how Linux handles hidden files and directories, which are indicated by a dot (.) at the beginning of their name.

- The manual pages are a set of pages that explain every command available on your system, including what they do, the specifics of how you run them, and what command line arguments they accept. You can invoke the manual pages with the following command: man <command to look up>. The tutorial explains the structure of the manual pages, which includes the command name, the synopsis, a description of the command, and a list of all the available command line options. You can also search the manual pages for a specific keyword or term, and you can search within a manual page. The tutorial also explains the differences between long hand and short hand command line options, and provides some activities for practicing with the ls command and searching through the manual pages.

- The tutorial then explains how to remove directories using the "rmdir" command, and how to create blank files using the "touch" command. Finally, it covers how to copy files and directories using the "cp" command. The tutorial emphasizes the importance of organizing files in an elegant file structure and using the command line effectively by understanding how different commands function.

- The cheat sheet provides a quick reference for using the Linux command line. It covers basic navigation commands like pwd, ls, and cd, as well as file manipulation commands like mkdir, touch, cp, and rm. It also includes information on permissions, process management, and filters like grep and sort. Additionally, it covers piping and redirection, wildcards, and provides some useful commands for finding file sizes, shutting down the system, and more. It's important to note that this cheat sheet assumes some familiarity with the Linux command line, so if you're new to it, it's recommended to start with a beginner's tutorial.


## Things I want to know more about

### what was technical skills with deliberate practice about ?

Improving technical skills is important for software developers, but it requires deliberate practice. This means challenging yourself just outside your comfort zone, repeating activities often, receiving feedback on results, and setting good goals. While it's important to push yourself, challenges should be surmountable and provide an opportunity to learn something new. The Matasano Crypto Challenges and Rosalind are examples of sets of challenges that meet these criteria. Developers should strive to learn new things and take on challenges that expand their knowledge beyond what they already know.

### what was Dr Carol Talking about ?

In the TED Talk discusses the "power of yet" and its importance in cultivating a growth mindset in children. She encourages parents and educators to focus on effort and progress rather than intelligence or talent, and to create classrooms that reward effort and strategy. This can help children develop confidence and persistence and achieve greater success in the long run.

### what did angela duckworth talking about ?

Angela Duckworth found that grit, defined as passion and perseverance for long-term goals, is the biggest predictor of success. She discovered this through studying kids and adults in challenging settings. To build grit in kids, we need to test and measure our best ideas and be willing to fail and start over. One idea for building grit is the growth mindset, which believes that the ability to learn can change with effort.

### what did Alain Do Bottom talking about ?

A gentler philosophy of success could focus on embracing the idea that success is not just about individual achievement, but also about the collective well-being of society. It could prioritize values such as empathy, kindness, and collaboration over individualism and competition. This approach would acknowledge that everyone's success is interconnected and that we all have a responsibility to contribute to the greater good.

Another aspect of a gentler philosophy of success could be accepting and embracing failure as an inevitable part of the learning process. This would involve recognizing that failure is not a personal weakness or a sign of incompetence, but a natural step in the journey towards success. This approach would encourage individuals to take risks, experiment, and learn from their mistakes, without fearing judgment or ridicule from others.

Ultimately, a gentler philosophy of success would prioritize personal growth and well-being over material wealth or social status. It would encourage individuals to define success on their own terms, based on their unique values and aspirations, rather than conforming to society's narrow definitions of success. This approach would help individuals lead more fulfilling and meaningful lives, while also contributing to a more compassionate and equitable society.
